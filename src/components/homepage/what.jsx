        We are creating a web app that helps users explore how their values and
        personal interests are being affected by climate change.

        We aim to inspire users to take action with a range of attractive
        solutions consistent with their values that they can get excited about.

        We are past the early stages of development and could use a few more
        hands to scale-up our progress.
