      <p>
        The finished product will guide users through the process of
        personalizing climate conversations with others and responding to common
        climate change myths. Then it will provide achievable action proposals
        that align with the values and interests of the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The knowledge base will collect knowledge available on climate change
        and interpret it as sets of concepts and the relationships between them.
